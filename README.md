# Dev-Environment
## Building a Dev Environment
In this project I'll utilize several TerraForm tools and functions such as:
- TerraForm
- state
- format
- replace
- console
- variables
- conditionals
- files
-  template
-  file
-  and more.



I'll also use AWS user data and local exec provisioner to bootstrap the EC2 instance and add its connection information to the VS code SSH configuration file, so it could be modified.
